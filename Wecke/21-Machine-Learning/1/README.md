# 21.1 Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview

Today's lesson plan introduces classical machine learning algorithms in the context of [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), covering data preprocessing and common machine learning algorithms.

## Class Objectives

* Calculate and apply regression analysis to datasets.
* Difference between linear and non-linear data.
* Quantify and validate linear models.
* Apply scaling and normalization as part of the data preprocessing step in machine learning.
